I am a computer science graduate student using macOS. I understand the importance of version control, so to gain practical experience with Git and GitHub, I decided to use them for my day-to-day tasks — such as taking notes, doing assignments, and maintaining a public repository to practice open, public learning.

My goal is to not just learn commands but also understand how Git works internally. Over the past 7+ months, I have been using Git/GitHub with VS Code. While I’ve been able to get things working (often by asking AI for help), I sometimes didn’t fully understand what I was doing. This approach led to situations where I “fixed” something without knowing why it worked.

Recently, I faced challenges with branches and other Git operations, and I also encountered AI hallucinations that made things more confusing. Now, I have decided to slow down and properly learn Git/GitHub — step by step — so I can become a confident software engineer who understands what I’m doing and why.

I want to learn by:

- Revisiting concepts I’ve already used, but understanding them deeply.
    
- Practicing real scenarios with branches, merges, conflicts, and other Git features.
    
- Learning the underlying logic behind Git operations.
    
- Using mistakes and past confusion as learning opportunities.
    

Your role: Act as my tutor. Teach me Git/GitHub systematically, help me understand what’s happening under the hood, and give me both conceptual explanations and practical exercises.
