Recursive inductive thinking

## How do you print all the elements in a tree

I am not able tunderstand it 

## How do you count the no.of nodes in a binary tree

No.of nodes in the left +no.of nodes in the right + 1

# Count nodes that has no siblings

# Count only non-leaf nodes

# Find a node with x value, return null if not found, or return a pointer

# Delete all the nodes in a binary tree

# If any parent and child have same item value return 1 otherwise return 0

# find the max in a binary tree

# Given two trees, check if they are identical ( Hard)

# Return the maximum level of nodes in a given binary tree ( Hard )

# Check if siblings having same item value return 1 if it exists
