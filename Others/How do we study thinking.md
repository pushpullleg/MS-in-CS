# Understanding Problem-Solving and Critical Thinking
*Workshop notes from Dr. Campbell's Math Club presentation*

## Key Concepts in Problem-Solving

### Distinguishing Between Problem-Solving Approaches
1. **Solving a Problem** vs **Problem Solving**
   - Solving a Problem: Focuses on finding the answer to a specific question
   - Problem Solving: Emphasizes the methodology and strategic approach to finding solutions

### The Problem-Solving Process

#### 1. Sense Making
- Initial comprehension phase:
  - Careful reading of the question
  - Identifying known information
  - Understanding what is being asked
  - Listing given constraints and requirements

#### 2. Representing and Connecting
- Visual organization of information:
  - Drawing diagrams or pictures
  - Creating visual representations
  - Making connections between different pieces of information
  - Using charts or graphs when applicable

### Research Methodologies

#### Grounded Theory Approach
A systematic research methodology that:
- Starts without pre-existing hypotheses
- Develops theories through analyzing real-world data
- Follows an inductive reasoning process
- Allows patterns and theories to emerge from observations

### Problem-Solving Strategies

1. **Reexamination Strategy**
   - Systematic review of solutions
   - Going back to verify answers
   - Double-checking assumptions
   - Validating each step of the process

2. **Linear Progression**
   - Step-by-step logical advancement
   - Moving from point A to B, then B to C
   - Building on previous knowledge
   - Sequential problem-solving approach

### Learning Support Methods

#### Scaffolding Approach
A structured learning support system:
- Provides temporary support structures
- Gradually reduces assistance as competence increases
- Promotes independent learning
- Builds confidence through guided practice

### Critical Thinking Elements

#### Justification vs. Reviewing
1. **Justification**
   - Providing evidence for decisions
   - Explaining methodology
   - Supporting claims with facts
   - Demonstrating logical reasoning

2. **Reviewing**
   - Reflecting on the process
   - Understanding cause and effect
   - Analyzing decision paths
   - Learning from the experience

## Best Practices for Problem-Solving
1. Break down complex problems into smaller parts
2. Use multiple representations when possible
3. Document your thinking process
4. Review and reflect on your approach
5. Learn from both successes and failures
