## **Difference between API and MCP 

- Calling an API directly means we have to design the schema, declare parameters, and maintain the integration ourselves, whereas MCP lets us outsource that work to an MCP server that already provides those tools.

- You skip building and maintaining all the API logic yourself, since the MCP server already has the schemas and functions ready.

- MCP doesn’t stop tool use; it just means the tools Claude calls are _predefined and managed_ by someone else (the MCP server), so you don’t have to build those tools yourself.

- You get instant access to a ready-made toolset, so you can integrate much faster and with less maintenance.

- MCP servers save you tons of time and effort by giving you ready-made tools, so your team can focus on building features instead of plumbing integrations.

Quick recap:

- MCP shifts tool definition and execution _off your server_ to specialized servers.

- It reduces maintenance and complexity.

- MCP servers wrap external APIs into easy-to-use, standardized tools.

- You still use tools; you just don’t write them.
