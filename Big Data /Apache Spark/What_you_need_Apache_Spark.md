Apache Spark has levels to it:

- Level 0
You can run spark-shell or pyspark, it means you can start

- Level 1
You understand the Spark execution model:
 • RDDs vs DataFrames vs Datasets
 • Transformations (map, filter, groupBy, join) vs Actions (collect, count, show)
 • Lazy execution & DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)
Master these concepts, and you’ll have a solid foundation


- Level 2 Optimizing Spark Queries
 • Understand Catalyst Optimizer and how it rewrites queries for efficiency.
 • Master columnar storage and Parquet vs JSON vs CSV.
 • Use broadcast joins to avoid shuffle nightmares
 • Shuffle operations are expensive. Reduce them with partitioning and good data modeling
 • Coalesce vs Repartition—know when to use them.
 • Avoid UDFs unless absolutely necessary (they bypass Catalyst optimization).

Level 3 Tuning for Performance at Scale
 • Master spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold.
 • Understand how Task Parallelism works and set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions properly.
 • Skewed Data? Use adaptive execution! 
 • Use EXPLAIN and queryExecution.debug to analyze execution plans.

- Level 4 Deep Dive into Cluster Resource Management
 • Spark on YARN vs Kubernetes vs Standalone—know the tradeoffs.
 • Understand Executor vs Driver Memory—tune spark.executor.memory and spark.driver.memory.
 • Dynamic allocation (spark.dynamicAllocation.enabled=true) can save costs.
 • When to use RDDs over DataFrames (spoiler: almost never).
