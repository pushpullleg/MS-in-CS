AI is being used in hospitals and clinics for analyzing symptoms, scans, and test data—Watson Health and K Health are real examples. These tools help doctors, but don’t replace them.

AI translation apps can handle real-time voice-to-voice translation for many languages. Some apps like DeepL and Google Translate now support spoken German and Arabic, but the quality isn’t near perfect, especially for less common language pairs or in super noisy places.

AI can make educated guesses about future trends using data, but true “future event prediction” (as in knowing the future like time travel) is impossible. There are too many unpredictable factors, and AI can’t see what hasn’t happened yet.

There are AI bots (GIB, Argine) that play bridge online and even beat human tournament champions sometimes. AI can play at a high level, though some human strategies are hard to copy.

Scientists can simulate small animal brains (like a mouse’s brain), but simulating all of the human brain’s complexity isn’t possible yet. Computing limits and our incomplete understanding of the brain make this infeasible for now.

Modern chatbots (ChatGPT, Gemini) can hold surprisingly good conversations, answer questions, and provide support for millions of users. They are a huge AI success story but aren’t perfect humans.

AI can analyze language and predict some emotional patterns or behavior, but it doesn’t have real emotions or true intuition about humans. Some new models do surprisingly well on emotional intelligence quizzes, but they don’t “understand” like humans do.

Robots and AI help in stores (stocking shelves, picking items for delivery), but an AI or robot that shops for a whole week’s groceries like a regular person—walking through aisles, choosing stuff, dealing with checkout—doesn’t really exist for everyday use yet.

Netflix, Amazon, and YouTube all use AI to recommend movies, shows, and products to individual users based on their habits. This is routine and works really well for most people.

No AI can actually “interpret” dreams in a meaningful or scientific way. At best, AI might find patterns in dream journals, but interpreting the meaning of dreams is still subjective and not something AI can do reliably.
