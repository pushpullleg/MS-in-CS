1. Habit Building 

It needs time to build an habit 

Attaching a time and habit to the stipulated time, if there is no class, solving the assignments

Some time for relaxation or back up as well

Time commitment for a particular day of time.

Attend classes- to grasp the concepts, 
Solving assignments , to put into test and retain concepts
And when you continue doing it , you stick to it for longer

3. Plan your week

When planning your week, it's essential to evaluate the probability of achieving your goals by breaking down each task. You can assess how likely you are to succeed by considering the time and effort each item requires. Reflecting on past experiences and available resources can help you make this assessment.

While it's important to stay focused and productive, don't overburden your schedule. Aim for balance and allow some flexibility in your plan. Overloading your week can result in burnout, so make sure to **leave room for reflection** and spontaneous adjustments.

Blocking time on your calendar is a great way to stay on track. Assign specific time slots to each task and stick to them. This structured approach minimizes distractions and enhances focus, helping you achieve your goals more efficiently.
