### why identifying use cases is the key to defining functional requirements ?

# user stories 

# acceptance criteria

# two techniques for identifying use cases

# user goal technique

# event decomposition technique


Note: Activity diagram is also called as workflow diagram 


### why identifying use cases is the key to defining functional requirements ?

Beacuse these for the basis of the list of funcitons the system needs to carry out.

# User Stories VS Use Cases

Concepts are similar

They differ in the approach , amount of the detail

User stories are favoured by Agile methodology 

# User Story template

â€œAs a <role played>,  I want to <goal or desire> so that <reason/benefit>

# User Acceptance Criteria 

Identify the feature that must be present for the user at the completion of task.
focusing on fucntionality, not on features or user-interface design 

## where the acceptance criteria is used?

They are used for testing.

User Story - Short description,Acceptance Criteria , In any language
Use Case- Short description with more detail , User flow or interaction , UML 

# User Goal technique

# Event Decomposition Technique 

First was done for real time systems

7 checklist 
		
## Type of Events

1. External Events

2. Temporal Events
As a result of achiving something after a point of time 
 Internal outputs: report to manager, payroll document
 External outputs: report to customer, monthly bill 
 
3. State Event (Internal Event)


Identify events that affects the system , tracing a sequence of transactions 
resulting in many ways

Event decomposition technique identify more cases than the 

# Perfect Technology Assumptions

At the user stories stage, we assume we have perfect techology, we dont need to worry about back up for database.


# Elementary Business Process (EBP)

EBP is a fundamental business process performed by one person, in one place, in response to a business event.

# Recall UML 

Unified Modeling Language

## What is Automation boundary?

the boundary between the computerized portion of the application and the users who operate the application
