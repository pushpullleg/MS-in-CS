Investigating System Requirements-Part II

Week-4 

In SDLC 3rd Discover and understand details 
Amongst the analysis activities 
Gather, define, prioiritize, develop,Evaluate 

# Functional and Non functional Requirement 
Constraints and Performance goal , reliability, 

#### How can we classify requirements?
FURPS/FURPS+

Usability - Color schemes,  Pinching 
Reliability - Fault tolerance , ACID compliants , Integrity 
Performance -Throughput ex: The system must process 1000 transactions per second under peak load
              Latency , resource utilisation, response time 
Security - password protect, encryption

When we design new system , we rank requirement 

+ plus requirement
  Design, Specific language, tools, protocols, interface , equipments physical facilities 

# Models and Modeling 

#### How do we define requirements?

### Textual Models - 
requirement in sentences and document 
memos, reports, 

### Graphical Models - 
diagram , schematic
here is where UML 
also describe use cases, 

### Mathematical models - 
formulas, stastics, algorithms 

##### Anlaysis and Design Models 
Swim Lane Diagram /Activity Diagram 

# Reason for Modeling 

reducing complexity of abstraction, documenting done for future 

Workflow with Activity Diagrams
Workflow - Sequence of processing steps 
Actvitiy Diagram- describe user activites, the person who does each acitivity , sequential flow of these activites.

Activity Diagram Symbols
- Swimlane heading ,actors and lanes , flow of activity
- Round oval - Describe activity
- solid dot starting and solid dot with circle is ending activity
- Diamond - Decision activity
- Synchronisation bar
  this is used not only to split for activities in parllel, but also to segmentation , pattern #interesting
