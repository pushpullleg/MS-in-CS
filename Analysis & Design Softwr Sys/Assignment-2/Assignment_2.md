1. What is the difference between systems analysis and design?

System Analysis is the process of figuring out exactly "what" the software needs to do. 
This involves talking to people, gathering user needs, identifying the problems faced, understanding the existing practices, and defining the requirements based on this information.

Whereas, 
System Design is the process that is done after the system analysis, figuring out "how" to build it. 
This includes activities such as creating a blueprint of the overall structure, making decisions about the architecture to follow, breaking down the system into smaller components, and designing how each part interacts through interfaces.

2. What is the purpose of the system development life cycle (SDLC)?

The SDLC is basically a well-defined structure that acts as a checklist in the development of software systems in the industry. It ensures that the software is of high quality, meets the requirements, mitigates risks, and includes detailed recorded documentation. Not only is the end product important, but the process also accommodates troubleshooting and adherence to standards.

Essentially, it is a framework that addresses every aspect involved in building software both technical and commercial aspect(Time and Money).

There are many approaches or methodologies to the SDLC, such as Waterfall, Agile, and Object-Oriented Analysis.

3. What are the six core processes for software systems development? 

Six core processes required in every SDLC are:

◼ Identify the problem or need and obtain approval

First, you need to figure out what problem you're trying to solve or what need you're addressing with your software.
Here, we talk to the people who will be using the software to understand their needs. Once we have a clear idea, we get the green light from management in charge to move forward with the project.

◼ Plan and monitor the project

Second, having a solid plan to guide the project and also checking where we are.

Here, we create a timeline, outline resources, and key milestones using project management tools to keep track of progress and make sure everything stays on schedule and within budget.

◼ Discover and understand the details

Thirdly, we dig deeper into the specifics of each and every aspect of the software and its functions.

Here, we document everything, including the functionality of what the software has to do and non-functional requirements such as performance and security.

◼ Design the system components that solve the problem

Fourthly, with the requirements in hand, we can start designing the system. By creating models, interfaces, and how different parts of the system will interact. We break the system into smaller chunks and design each one in detail.

◼ Build, test, and integrate system components

Fifthly, we start building the system. We write the code, test each component individually to make sure it works correctly, then integrate all the components and test the complete system to ensure everything works together as expected.

◼ Complete system tests and then deploy the solution

Finally, we test and deploy it on many devices, changing environments to check the readiness before delivery or making it public to the users.

We perform a series of various tests to check all the functional and non-functional aspects, and once everything is good to go, we deploy it in the production environment and provide training and support to the users.

4.4. (20 points) For each of the figures in lecture 01, which ones show the Tradeshow System overall, and 
which figures show the components that apply to the Supplier Subsystem?

a. System Vision Document (Figure 1-8)

This document typically provides an overall vision of the entire Tradeshow system, including its purpose, scope, and high-level requirements.

- Problem Description
- System capabilities 
- Business benefits

Yes! The question is asking you to categorize each figure from Lecture 01 into one of two groups:

Figures showing the Tradeshow System overall
Figures showing components specific to the Supplier Subsystem
How to approach the question:
Tradeshow System Overall → These figures will represent the entire system, including all subsystems, not just the supplier part.
Supplier Subsystem → These figures will focus only on the Supplier part of the system.
Analyzing Each Figure
Likely Representing the Overall Tradeshow System
These figures describe the system as a whole and its overall structure.

(a) System Vision Document (Figure 1-8): Defines the entire system’s purpose and scope, so it covers the full Tradeshow System.
(b) Work Breakdown Structure (Figure 1-9): Lists all major tasks for the system, not just the Supplier Subsystem.
(c) List of Use Cases (Figure 1-11): Contains use cases for the entire system, although some may be related to suppliers.
(d) List of Domain Classes (Figure 1-12): Lists all domain objects for the whole system. Some will apply to suppliers, but it's still for the whole system.
(e) Domain Class Diagram (Figure 1-13): Shows relationships between domain classes across the whole system.
(f) Use Case Diagram (Figure 1-14): Depicts how users interact with the system as a whole.
(i) Database Design (Figure 1-17): Covers the database structure for the entire system, including suppliers.
(j) Component Diagram (Figure 1-18): Shows all components and how they interact system-wide.
(l) Software Architecture (Figure 1-20): Provides a high-level structure of the whole Tradeshow System.
Likely Representing the Supplier Subsystem
These figures are specific to supplier-related components and functionality.

(g) Activity Diagram (Figure 1-15): Likely focuses on the flow of activities related to supplier interactions.
(h) Initial Screen Layout (Figure 1-16): Shows UI screens that are probably designed for suppliers.
(k) Design Class Diagram (Figure 1-19): Likely focuses on supplier-related classes and their interactions.
(m) Code for SupplierView Class (Figure 1-21): This directly refers to code specific to the supplier functionality.
(n) Screen Capture (Figure 1-23): If it shows a supplier-related interface, it belongs to the Supplier Subsystem.
