TE Sheet Project Documentation
1. Identify the Problem or Need and Obtain Approval
What problem or need were you addressing with your software?

I am working for the TITLE III program at ETAMU. The goal was to track the time and effort of the faculty and Graduate Assistants (GA) in TITLE III, and automate the calculation of task activities and grouping.
Who were the stakeholders or users you talked to in order to understand their needs?

As a GA myself, I experienced the pain of manually filling out PDFs, calculating hours, and categorizing activities. I also discussed these issues with other GAs and faculty members.
How did you gather the requirements from these stakeholders?

I gathered requirements through direct conversations and personal experience, understanding the specific pain points and needs.
What steps did you take to get approval from your manager, Dr. Shavel, to proceed with the project?

I shared my idea with Dr. Shavel, explaining the difficulties in categorizing activities and manually calculating hours. I highlighted how time-consuming and error-prone the current process was, and she approved the project.
2. Plan and Monitor the Project
What was your initial project plan?

My plan was to create an automated system to minimize user interaction and time spent on the task.
How did you outline the resources and key milestones for the project?

I focused on key functionalities such as calculation, dropdown selection, automatic categorization, and summing up activities.
What project management tools did you use to keep track of progress?

I did not use any formal project management tools. In hindsight, I should have used simple tools like Trello or Asana to track progress.
How did you ensure that the project stayed on schedule and within budget?

There was no formal budget as this was a side project. However, it took more time than expected. In the future, I would evaluate time spent and set clear milestones to stay on track.
3. Discover and Understand the Details
How did you gather detailed requirements for the software?

I worked closely with Dr. Shavel to understand her requirements, such as user-authenticated digital signatures with dates, easy PDF conversion, and preserving the existing design format.
What methods did you use to document the functional and non-functional requirements?

I did not formally document these requirements, but I now realize the importance of doing so. In the future, I would use tools like Microsoft Word or Google Docs to document requirements.
Were there any specific challenges you faced during this phase? If so, how did you overcome them?

Design alignment was a major challenge. Changes in Excel often disrupted the layout. I overcame this by carefully adjusting the design and ensuring consistency across different codes and options.
4. Design the System Components that Solve the Problem
What was your approach to designing the system architecture?

I used Excel to replicate the initial PDF design, incorporating formulas and macros as needed.
How did you create models and interfaces for the system?

I created the models and interfaces in Excel, ensuring they closely matched the original PDF design. The final Excel sheet needed to be easily convertible to PDF.
How did you ensure that different parts of the system would interact correctly?

I keyed in all values and created separate sheets for different roles (faculty, career navigator, management, GA) to ensure correct interaction.
Did you break the system into smaller components? If so, how did you design each one in detail?

Yes, I grouped faculty by categories and designed each component in detail, ensuring they met specific needs.
5. Build, Test, and Integrate System Components
How did you approach the coding phase?

I started with a small section where calculations happened, built it, tested it, and visualized the results.
What testing methods did you use to ensure each component worked correctly?

I manually tested each component to ensure it worked correctly.
How did you integrate all the components into a complete system?

I integrated all components by organizing them into different sheets and sub-sheets, ensuring calculations were accurate.
What types of tests did you perform to ensure everything worked together as expected?

I sent the sheets to different PCs and asked colleagues to manually input different options to test the system.
6. Complete System Tests and Then Deploy the Solution
What types of system tests did you perform before deployment?

I performed trial and error and manual testing. In the future, I would include automated tests and user acceptance testing.
How did you test the software on different devices and environments?

I asked my manager and colleagues to test the software on their computers.
What steps did you take to ensure the system was ready for deployment?

After developing a template, I converted it to PDF and ensured digital signatures worked correctly.
How did you deploy the software to the production environment?

I shared the final version with individuals and maintained it on a shared drive.
Did you provide training and support to the users? If so, how?

Yes, I conducted a presentation on the time and effort sheet, walking through each aspect of it.
Additional Questions
What were the key challenges you faced during the entire SDLC process?

Time management, design alignment, converting Excel to PDF, and maintaining orientation were significant challenges.
How did you address any issues or obstacles that arose?

I addressed issues by working through them one by one, having a backup plan, and using images where necessary.
What lessons did you learn from this project that you would apply to future projects?

I learned the importance of page view, margins, Adobe signatures, and the need for proper documentation.
How did you document your process and findings throughout the project?

I am documenting my process and findings now to ensure I have a detailed record for future reference.
