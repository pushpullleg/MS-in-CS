## Use Case

_A use case can have more than one scenario (special case or more specific path)

note : Not all use cases are modelled at the same level of detail
_
 Note : User stories are sometimes used in place of use cases with Agile development

 Two types
 1. Brief Use Case Description
 2. Fully Developed use case description


### How usually the use case looks like ?

Verb and Noun 

### How Use case are identified?

1. User goal technique
2. Event Decomposition Technique

## Activity Diagram
- flow of activity


## SSD - System Sequence Diagram 

It shows the input and output **for each use case** as messages.

Steps to develop SSD
1. Identify input message
2. Describe the message from external actor to the system
3. Identify any special conditions
4. Identify and add output return values

## CRUD Analysis

correlates problem domain classes and use case,is an effective technique to double check that all required use cases have been identified


for what?
- validate use cases 

Ensure that all classes have a complete “cover” of use case

Note not for primary identification of use case

## CRUD STEPS

1. Identify all domain classes
2. For each classes verify use case exist to CRUD
3. Add new cases as required , identify responsible stakeholders
4. Identify which applicaiton has responsibility for each action : which to create, which to update, which to use 

## UML Diagram

- UML Activity Diagram
- UML System Sequence Diagram

UML ActivityDiagram shows flow of activity only 

## UML Diagram and Use Case Description

What UML shows?

### What is the main objective of "defining requirement" in system development ?

- Understanding user needs
- How the business process is carried out
- How the system will be used to support those business processes.


Summary : 

Fully Developed use case description
UML activity diagram 
UML system sequence diagrams (SSD)
CRUD Analysis 

All the above techniques and models will allow extend the requirement models to show additional info about the system.

Integrate and fully document it 

### How usually record and store aboout the business process
Manual system - recorded paper, filling cabinet 
Automated system - electonic files and database 



## Why fully developed use case description is needed?

Some are complex requirements and hence use case and user stories  (user goal and event decomposition ) alone is not enough.


## Why do we need a SSD , not just use case diagram?

We have Actor and System in the Use case , however how they interact and what message , interaction with systems.


## What are the components covered in fully developed use case description?

- use case 
- scenario
- actors
- triggering event
- brief description
- Related use case 
- stakeholder
- precondition
- postcondition
- flow of activity  ( Activity diagram can be used)
- exception condition 

It is the most formal method.

Fully developed use case description increases the probablity that you thoroughly understand the business process.


Q:Is this is a standard universal fromat?
Can the order be changed?
