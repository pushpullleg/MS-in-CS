1. **Git basics and initialization**
    
    - Created a repo with `git init`
        
    - Understood the three zones: working directory, staging area (index), and repository (committed history)
        
    - Used `git status` to check the state of your repo
        
2. **Tracking changes**
    
    - Added files with `git add`
        
    - Committed changes with `git commit -m`
        
    - Learned the difference between staged and unstaged changes
        
3. **Undoing changes**
    
    - Unstaged changes using `git restore --staged <file>`
        
    - Discarded working directory changes with `git restore <file>`
        
    - Used `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo commits but keep changes staged
        
4. **Branching and merging**
    
    - Created branches (`git branch`, `git checkout -b`)
        
    - Switched branches (`git checkout`)
        
    - Merged branches and encountered merge conflicts
        
    - Learned how to read and resolve conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
        
5. **Commit hashes**
    
    - Saw the SHA-1 hash (e.g. `7bf71db`) representing commits
        
6. **Understanding staging vs working directory states**
    
    - What happens when you stage, restore, commit, and how these affect the file states
