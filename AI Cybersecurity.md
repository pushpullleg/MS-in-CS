AI and automation
AI
investrigate, identify ,report,research
Automation → Work more efficiently
Artificial Intelligence → Work more intelligently


Knowledge graphs enable comprehensive threat investigation and relationship mapping

Challenge:

Systems generate massive volumes of log records
Each log contains: timestamp, user, action, target system, source location
Difficult to identify anomalous activities manually

AI Solution: Pattern Recognition

Uses machine learning for advanced pattern matching
Applies time decay functions to analyze activity sequences
Identifies outliers and anomalies across multiple records



Example Attack Scenario:

Privileged user logs in
Creates new account (immediately)
Copies entire database (immediately)
Deletes account (immediately)

Individual actions seem normal, but the sequence and timing indicate potential insider threat

Automated reporting improves compliance efficiency
AI-powered research tools enhance investigation capabilities
The integration of AI is becoming standard across security products
