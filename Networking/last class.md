Link layer

brodcasting IP Address
Brodcasting Physical address

Unknown IP address

How shared communication 
-channel partioninng, 
-taking turns  moderato
- token passing - token ring - developed by IBM - ethernet competitor
why? fault olerance issue
- random access
kiss- keep it simple and stupid 
collision problem, hence detection and recovery
how to recover? retransmit after time out event , works on probability 

Binary backoff technique-to retransmit after collision


CSMA/CD


how communciation happens in link llayer?
datagram,frame encapuslation 

how mac address wihtin the same network ?

command line : arp 
by referning to this table, 

if no info about the destination mac in the arp protocol
we use boradcasting adddress ff-ff-ff-ff-ff-ff

Network Devices:
1. Router
   - Physical network device
   - Connects different networks
   - Works with IP addresses (Layer 3)
   - Routes packets between networks

2. Switch
   - Physical network device
   - Connects devices within same network
   - Works with MAC addresses (Layer 2)
   - Uses MAC address table for forwarding
   - More efficient than hubs (predecessor to switches)
